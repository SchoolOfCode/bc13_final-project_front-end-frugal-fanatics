PLAN

Build onboarding.js component with complete form
Landing container is the parent component
The children components are the pages (Income, Expenses, Savings) which are rendered within that based on the State

1. Render Income within onboarding.js
2. Within Income render the appropriate components: Formsteps, FormDescription, Heading (within Form), Form (with Input and Submit button nested within), Input (with label passed down as props), and finally Submit button (with props that change the text therein)
