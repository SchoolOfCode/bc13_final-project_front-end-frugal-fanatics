The cost of living crisis is like trying to fill a bucket with a hole in it. No matter how much you pour in, it just keeps leaking out. It's become a cause of stress for many of us as we try to make ends meet and afford the things we need. But don't worry, there's a solution that doesn't involve plugging the hole with your fingers. It's our budgeting app!


<h2 id="Our-Solution">Our solution</h2>

Frumo aims to make managing your money fun and easy. Our gamified tools help you set and achieve personal goals, while providing helpful resources for money decisions.

In short, our app is an easy, fun and effective way to take control of your finances and manage the cost of living crisis.

<h2 id="Instructions">Instructions</h2>


To get started on the Frumo website, navigate to the homepage and click on the "Get Started" button. This will take you to the onboarding section where you can add information about your income, savings, and expenses. Once you have completed these steps, press the "Get Tailored Results" button.

You will then be directed to the sign in/sign up page. If this is your first time using the website, please select "Don't have an account? Sign Up" and enter your email and desired password. For demo purposes we have disabled email verification so feel free to use a dummy email address.

Once you have completed the sign-up process, your personalised dashboard will show on the overview page. You can also navigate to the budgeting or savings sections by clicking the corresponding tabs on the left-hand navigation bar. On the budgeting tab you can view expenses compared to your income. On the savings tab, you can set saving targets via the savings pots ("add savings button") and track your progress towards reaching them. Why not try adding savings to a pot?
